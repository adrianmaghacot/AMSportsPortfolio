								<h2>Who Stood Out?</h2>
								<p>After the event, head coach Stan Drayton and six players spoke to the media:</p>								
                                				<h3>E.J. Warner</h3>
                                				<h3>David Martin-Robinson</h3>
                                				<h3>Jordan Magee</h3>
                                				<h3>D‚ÄôWan Mathis</h3>
                                				<h3>Jalen McMurray</h3>
                                				<h3>Demerick Morris</h3>
								<p>Below are excerpts of their sessions.</p>
                                				<h3>Drayton on the goals of Cherry and White Day:</h3>
								<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs another opportunity to get better as a football team, and we can‚Äôt take that for granted. We didn‚Äôt show a whole lot schematically but we still came out and we hit and we tackled. That‚Äôs something that showed up today in a positive light‚Ä¶We got done what we needed to get done.‚Äù</p>
								<h3>Drayton on Warner‚Äôs development over the spring:</h3>
								<p>‚ÄúE.J. has had a phenomenal spring. He continues to grow as a person and is becoming a leader. He‚Äôs got a lot of people following him right now, and I think he‚Äôs handling that very well‚Ä¶He‚Äôs our guy and we‚Äôre rallying behind him.‚Äù</p>
								<h3>Warner on his first college spring practice season:</h3>
								<p>‚ÄúIt was so much fun. Being with those guys for 15 days this spring, playing the sport we love, that‚Äôs why we came here. Have a ball, talk trash, make plays; it‚Äôs been good‚Ä¶It‚Äôs been really good, I‚Äôm having a great time, and I love those guys.‚Äù</p>
								<h3>Warner on his improvement this offseason:</h3>
								<p>‚ÄúI think definitely leadership. I think coming in last year as a young guy, I didn‚Äôt try to use my voice too much. I tried to earn that respect through my play. I think these guys respect me now because I‚Äôve put in the work and put in the time and we can come out here and they‚Äôll listen to me.‚Äù </p>
								<h3>Graduate tight end David Martin-Robinson on the development of the tight ends:</h3>
								<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a bunch of young guys in my room [tight ends room] that want to learn and want to be on the field, so that makes it a lot easier when you‚Äôre talking to them.‚Äù</p>
								<h3>Demerick Morris on former defensive coordinator D.J. Eliot‚Äôs departure:</h3>
								<p>‚ÄúCoach Withers is a really good defensive coordinator, and there was really no drop off from it. Once we got the news that he got the promotion, we congratulated him and didn‚Äôt flinch.‚Äù</p>
                                				<h2>What‚Äôs Next?</h2>
								<p>The Owls will play Akron in their season opener Sep. 2 at Lincoln Financial Field.</p>
