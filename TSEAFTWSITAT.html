								<p>Wichita State got out to an early eight-point run and didn‚Äôt allow Temple to score until the 5:18 mark in the first quarter. In addition to the 27% shooting, the Owls struggled with securing the ball as the team had five turnovers in the first.</p>
								<p>On the other hand, McCarty and forward Jane Asinde led the Snickers after out rebounding the Owls and scoring 11 of the team‚Äôs 17 first-quarter points.</p>
								<p>Early in the second quarter, Temple started to cut the Wichita State lead all the way to five. However, the later half of the quarter was a struggle for the Owls as they had many opportunities to score, but missed eight straight shots in the span of three minutes.</p>
								<p>Wichita State only shot the ball 12 times and made five of them in the second quarter, but the lack of made shots from the Owls allowed the Shockers to keep a seven-point lead heading into halftime.</p>
								<p>Going into the second half, both teams started getting into their respective rhythms, but the Owls were closing in on a comeback. Guard Tarriyonna Gary took control by scoring eight points, including a buzzer-beating three pointer to cut the Shocker‚Äôs lead to three at the end of the third quarter.</p>
