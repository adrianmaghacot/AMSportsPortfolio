								<p>Temple Volleyball (3-0, 0-0 American Athletic Conference) started its season off 3-0 and without dropping a set for the first time since 2019. The Owls swept the Cherry & White Challenge this weekend, winning every set against Iona (1-2, 0-0 MAAC), Long Island (0-3, 0-0 Northeast Conference) and Lehigh (2-1, 0-0 Patriot League).</p>
								<p>“People keep telling me something is different about this team,” said Temple head coach Linda Hampton-Keith, who is in her second year as head of the program. “This is a pretty cool team.“</p>
								<h2>First Game vs. Iona</h2>
								<p>Temple started the tournament on a high note, beating Iona in three sets (25-16, 25-18, 25-16). Outside hitter Taylor Davenport led the way, scoring 23 points. Right-side hitter Avery Luoma, who made first-team all-Ivy League last season at Princeton, had a strong performance in her Temple debut with six kills, five digs and two blocks.</p>
								<p>Hampton-Keith noticed Davenport, particularly her offensive impact.</p>
								<p>“She [Davenport] went through the ups and downs of learning a new position, and today, she just owned it,” Hampton-Keith said.</p>
								<p>The Owls were more efficient than Iona, as Temple had a hitting percentage of .316 while Iona finished at .054. Temple’s ability to reduce their number of errors allowed them to go on small runs of points throughout each set.</p>
                <p>The Gaels’ offense was led by outside hitters Mackenzie Wiggins and Greta Stjade with 13 kills combined.</p>
								<h2>Second game vs. LIU</h2>
								<p>A day later, the Owls struggled in the first set against Long Island compared to their performance against Iona. Temple jumped out to a 15-11 lead, but Long Island took advantage of six Temple attack errors, including four in a run of five points, to take a 21-17 lead.</p>
								<p>However, Temple, was resilient and won the first set 25-23. Temple then won the final two sets by at least seven points, taking set 2 25-18 and set 3 25-16.</p>
                <p>“We showed some resilience and kept our cool, and continued to execute when things were tough,” Hampton-Keith said.</p>
								<p>Davenport followed up the previous game with a 20-kill performance. Luoma and middle blocker Chelci Banks made impacts as well, adding 16 combined kills.</p>
								<h2>Final Game vs. Lehigh</h2>
								<p>In the Owls’ final tournament game, they swept Lehigh 25-19, 25-21 and 26-24. Davenport finished the game with 19 kills, and outside hitters Jelena Prolic and Luoma had eight kills each.</p>
								<p>Following the Lehigh game, Luoma and setter Patrycja Zielinska made the all-tournament team for their respective positions, and Davenport was named the MVP.</p>
								<p>The Owls will remain at home to face Delaware State (2-1, 0-0 MEAC) on Aug. 29 at 6 p.m.</p>
