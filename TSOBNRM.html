								<p>Temple Women’s Soccer (2-12-3, 0-8 American Athletic Conference) lost to No. 10 Memphis (14-1, 8-0 AAC) 4-0 Sunday afternoon. The Owls were able to hold their own in the first half, entering halftime with the score tied at zero. The second half was a different story, as the Tigers broke through with four goals, and the Owls were unable to respond.</p>
								<p>The loss marks the 19 consecutive conference defeats for the Owls, with their last win coming against Houston on Oct.17, 2021.</p>
								<h2>KEY MOMENTS</h2>
								<p>In the 46th minute, Memphis forward/midfielder Saorla Miller punched the ball to the back of the net to break the tie for the Tigers.</p>
								<p>Just four minutes after the first goal, Memphis was able to extend their lead after midfielder Honoka Hamano fired a shot into the left side of the net.</p>
								<p>Hamano was able to find Memphis forward/midfielder Mya Jones, who snuck a shot past Temple goalkeeper Tasmin Bynoe in the 59th minute, to put the game out of reach.</p>
                						<p>Jones found the back of the net again 10 minutes later, after her kick banked off the left crossbar and went into the net, extending the Tigers’ lead to four.</p>
								<h2>THE NUMBERS</h2>
								<p>Memphis played aggressively on offense the entire game, as the Tigers shot the ball 22 times, while Temple only shot twice, their lowest of the season.</p>
								<p>Despite the volume shooting, Bynoe saved seven balls from reaching the goal.</p>
                						<p>The Owls didn’t attempt a corner kick all game, the Tigers had eight corner kicks in the contest.</p>
								<p>For the seventh straight game, the Owls were unable to put the ball in the back of the net since their win against Penn. The loss marked the twelfth game this season Temple has been held scoreless.</p>
								<h2>ON TAP</h2>
								<p>The Owls will have one more opportunity for a conference win when they travel to Birmingham, Alabama to take on UAB (5-6-5, 1-3-4 AAC) on Oct. 26 at 8 p.m. for their final matchup of the season.</p>

								<p>Temple Women’s Soccer (2-11-3, 0-7 American Athletic Conference) lost on the road to Tulsa (3-7-5, 1-1-4 AAC) 5-0 Thursday afternoon. This is the Owls’ sixth straight shutout loss and their 10th of the season.</p>
								<h2>KEY MOMENTS</h2>
								<p>In the third minute, Tulsa midfielder Kayla Fernandez scored off with assists from midfielder Piper Szafranski and forward Jordan Frederick. Tulsa took an early 1-0 lead and built momentum from there.</p>
								<p>10 minutes later, Fredrick positioned the ball to the middle and gave Szafranski an opportunity to sneak the ball in the net past Temple goalkeeper Taylor Vecchione. Though she got a hand on it, Vecchione could not make the save, and Tulsa went up 2-0.</p>
								<p>In the 58th minute, Frederick fired a shot, and Owls defender Phoebe Hollin attempted to defend it. Hollin deflected the ball into the Owls’ goal and extended the Golden Hurricane’s lead to 3-0.</p>
                <p>Tulsa went up 4-0 in the 64th minute after midfielder Maggie SymSmith scored off a corner kick.</p>
								<p>Four minutes later, Golden Hurricane forward Leah Diaz weaved around several defenders and kicked the ball above Vecchione for Tulsa’s fifth and final goal.</p>
								<h2>THE NUMBERS</h2>
								<p>The Owls had just five shots in the first half and 12 by the end of the game, primarily due to heavy pressure from the Golden Hurricane.</p>
								<p>Frederick and defender Madison Tokarchik led Tulsa with five shots each, while defender/midfielder Beky Myers led Temple with three.</p>
                <p>While the Owls were unable to get rhythm from the offense, Vecchione played the entire match, recording seven saves.</p>
								<p>This is Temple’s largest goal differential since its 5-0 loss to Providence Sept. 3.</p>
								<h2>ON TAP</h2>
								<p>The Owls will continue their last three-game road stretch of the season when they play conference-leading Memphis (12-1, 6-0 AAC) Oct. 22 at 2 p.m.</p>
